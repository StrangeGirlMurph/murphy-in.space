<h1>Scientific Knowledge Base (<i>Coming Soon™</i>)</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		During my studies I take a lot of notes. All these notes and everything else I learn ends up in
		my knowledge base. It's an
		<a class="link" href="http://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>
		vault written in German which I want to share with everyone over a website and GitHub under a
		<a class="link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">
			CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License</a
		>. The vault is basically my own little Wikipedia with all the definitions, concepts, theorems
		and so on I learn. <!-- Because it's all written in German mostly my fellow students from Uni and
		maybe some other German speaking people will find it useful and get something out of it. -->

<h1>History</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		I am currently studying Computer Science, Mathematics & Physics. It's a challenging combination
		of all three disciplines. I am having the same courses as the regular math/physics/cs students.
		Just not all of them and my bachelor is longer. Before I started this bachelor I studied
		Computer Science & Computational Science somewhere else for a year. It allowed me to take
		courses on physics and cognitive neurosciences but it was just too applied and tbh too easy for
		me. Plus I wanted more and serious math. Not just math for cs.

<h1>Ambition</h1>
<section>
	<p>
		I don't worry too much about my university grades. I don't want and need the fanciest education
		and high paying jobs in the world. Neither do I want to work in the academic field. I want to
		solve real world problems not end up in fundamental research. As I explained in the About Me: I
		want to help people and save the world. That's why I decided I'd rather work on useful and
		impressive projects during my studies that directly benefit humanity than spend my time
		endlessly studying for exams and memorizing things I can always just look up later. A GitHub
		profile with useful code is more important to me than some number on a piece of paper. Don't get
		me wrong! I very ambitions when it comes to learning and understanding the concepts in my
		bachelor and actually working towards being able to use that knowledge whenever I need it.
