        I am currently working on some big things I want to share with everyone out there (although they will probably mostly be useful for the students at my university). I will update this page as soon as I have something to show!

        I am currently studying "Computer Science, Mathematics & Physics" in my first semester. It's a tough combination of all three disciplines. I am having the same courses as the regular math/physics/cs students. Just not all of them and my bachelor is longer. Before I started my new bachelor I studied Computer Science & Computational Science somewhere else for a year. It allowed me to take courses on physics and cognitive neurosciences but it was just to applied for me and tbh just to easy. Plus I wanted more and serious math. Not just math for cs.
